# Shard Fusion Rules, In Order

1. If there is a chameleon present, look for the next three incremental IDs in the same rarity. 
If the IDs are not present, start counting in the next rarity up from 1.
2. For each shard category in the fusion, look for the next incremental ID in the same rarity and category that is a possible basic fuse target.
Shards that are crafted, bought, or fusion-only are typically not possible basic fuse targets.
If both shards are the same category, ignore the one with lower rarity, or the first one if both have the same rarity.
3. Special fusion
Order: Higher rarity first, then lower number first
